We are in a special time when peace is most needed. The good thing is that we can all contribute to it. Achieving a sense of peace is not limited to monks, mystics, and hermits. The truth is that we all benefit from peace for our own wellbeing. And, peace can be achieved even in home with family and at work place with co-workers. We know that peaceful people live much happier lives than others.
Peace, inner peace, or peace of mind is a state of being mentally, emotionally, and spiritually at peace in face of daily stresses, anxieties, worries, disturbances, and chaos. It is consciously keeping our mind at peace regardless of external circumstances, including what people might think or say about us

Every day, there are many ways to accomplish that, including practicing:

Gratitude

Forgiveness

Caring for others
Clearing the mind
